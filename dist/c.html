															A long, long time ago, we traded things for things.

															Notes (paper representing gold) caught on and notes were used, gold stayed in banks.

															Banks began lending out the gold they were storing.

												Federal Reserve makes money and gives it to:
												- Government 
												- Banks 


												Government borrows more than they can pay back (28 trillion)

												

												Gold, silver, digging and rifining is difficult. 
												Limited supply. This makes supply stable and prices stable.


												People started putting gold in bank, bank gives them a note 
												Note can be redeemed for the gold 
												Notes became the thing, easier to carry

												Banks began lending out the gold since everyone carried notes 
												- Increased the amount of money in supply (original gold + lent out gold)
												- Federal Reserve began managing banks so they could continue lending 


												1971, cash detached from gold 
												Federal Reserve can print as much as they want 

											
												More money, more spending, prices go up, inflation  

												Money facilitates the exchange of goods and services. It allows us to sell a car and buy a truck in the same day without having to find someone who wants to exchange a truck for a car.
												<br></br>

												It was once pieces of silver and gold, later it was coins, then dollars, now it's becoming digital currencies.  Along the way, money made a few significant changes.
												<br></br>

												Precious metals have intrinsic value while Fiat money derives its value by government declaring that it has value. In the U.S., the dollar is legal tender--everyone is obligated to accept dollars for use in basic economic activities.
												<br></br>

												<h3>Now</h3>
												<br></br>

												The global economy is about to transform  
												<br></br>

												Our Current System:
												<br></br> 

												The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy and operates key electronic payment systems.  They act as intermediary when banks transfer money between each other
												<br></br>   


												Banks allow us to make valid exchanges: 
											<ul>
												<li>without having physical possession of currency</li> 
												<li>without being in the same physical location as the payee</li> 
												<li>without knowing/trusting the payee</li>  
											</ul>

												Banks also safekeep our money to reduce the risk of theft, loss, destruction, etc.   

												<h3>Crypto</h3>
												<br></br>
												Cryptocurrencies are designed to be an alternate electronic payment systems:

												<ul>
													<li>A network of computers validates transactions instead of a bank</li>
													<li>Cryptography is used to authenticate instead of banks</li>
													<li>Accounts, balances, and transactions are tracked on a ledger</li>
												</ul>
																		
																

												Pros:

												<li>Money is not backed by government-fiat currency</li>
												<li>Less time for transactions</li>
												<li>Less fees to banks, credit card companies</li>
												<li>Less private data to banks and payees</li>

												Level 1 Chains:
												BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT, AVAX, Terra, MATIC, ALGO, COSMOS,

											All computers running the app (called nodes) maintain a copy of the ledger.  Every transaction is sent to all the nodes and is added to the blockchain.

												To keep a node from adding a fraudulent transaction, a complex math problem must be solved by a node before they can add a block into the ledger.  The first node to solve the problem gets a reward in coins and is allowed to write the block into the ledger. (Proof of work) (ETH 1.0)

												An alternate way is picking a node randomly based on the amount of funds "staked" on a node.  The more staked funds, the higher chance a node has of being selected to get a reward and forge a block. To prevent a node from getting to forge a majority of the blocks, at a certain point more staked funds actually decreases a node's chance of being selected. (Proof of stake) (ETH 2.0)

															Anchor app allows you to borrow against collateral.

															1. Deposit 100 UST in EARN

															2. Post $270 worth of bLUNA to collateral

															3. You can now borrow $120 UST against the $370 deposited

															Loan to Value (LTV) is at 33% so LUNA would need to drop by ~70% to get liquidated

															## Liquidations with KUJI

															Kujira allows you to buy bLUNA from liquidated loans at a discount:

															1. You make a bid for LUNA at 10% premium on KUJI app

															2. Value of LUNA drops 80% and the above loan is liquidated

	<p>
		Yield farming is the practice of staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency
	</p>
	<p>
		Tokens are farmed in these liquidity pools, in exchange for providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
		Liquidity mining occurs when a yield farming participant earns token rewards as additional compensation, and came to prominence after Compound started issuing the skyrocketing COMP, its governance token, to its platform users.
		Most yield farming protocols now reward liquidity providers with governance tokens, which can usually be traded on both centralized exchanges like Binance and decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

		Could result in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/impermanent-loss" target="_blank">impermenant loss</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Liquidity pools often feature two assets — and while one might be a stablecoin such as DAI, the other could be a more volatile cryptocurrency such as ETH.
		Let’s imagine that a provider needs to offer equal levels of liquidity in both DAI and ETH — but suddenly, the price of ETH goes up.

		This creates an irresistible opportunity for arbitrage, because the price of ETH in the liquidity pool now doesn’t reflect what’s going on in the real world. To ensure the ratio of DAI to ETH remains balanced, other traders will buy ETH at a discounted rate until there’s equilibrium again.
		After arbitrage, a liquidity provider may end up with a greater amount of DAI and slightly less ETH. Impairment loss assesses the current value of their assets against what they would be worth if left sitting pretty in an exchange.

	</p>
	<p>
		dApps typically do not rely on trust and they do not require custodians or middlemen to function, which essentially makes them ‘trustless’. These inherently decentralised qualities allow dApps to perform a wide selection of use cases, including decentralised trading, lending, borrowing, staking, liquidity provision and, more importantly, yield farming.

		Yield farming is one of the newer liquidity concepts to e

		yield farming process resembles that of staking, but with a few extra added complexities.

		In most cases, yield farming requires users, called liquidity providers (LPs), to add funds to a protocol’s liquidity pool. Liquidity pools are basically smart contracts that store and preserve users’ funds, and they reward users for providing liquidity in the first place. These rewards may come from fees generated by the underlying DeFi protocol, or from some other sources.

		otal Value Locked (TVL) is the sum of all funds locked in a protocol’s liquidity pool. This is a very important metric to measure how healthy a yield farming platform is. An increase in the Total Value Locked leads to an increase in the yield farming on a platform. The current TVL for DeFi is approximately $64 billion, and these metrics can be tracked on DeFi Pulse.

		Level 1 Chains:
		BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT, AVAX, Terra, MATIC, ALGO, COSMOS,

		All computers running the app (called nodes) maintain a copy of the ledger.  Every transaction is sent to all the nodes and is added to the blockchain.

		To keep a node from adding a fraudulent transaction, a complex math problem must be solved by a node before they can add a block into the ledger.  The first node to solve the problem gets a reward in coins and is allowed to write the block into the ledger. (Proof of work) (ETH 1.0)

		An alternate way is picking a node randomly based on the amount of funds "staked" on a node.  The more staked funds, the higher chance a node has of being selected to get a reward and forge a block. To prevent a node from getting to forge a majority of the blocks, at a certain point more staked funds actually decreases a node's chance of being selected. (Proof of stake) (ETH 2.0)

		Gen1 - Bitcoin  (store of value)
		Gen2 - Ethereum, Binance (smart contracts that have utility)
		Gen3 - Cardano, IOTA (smart contracts with proof of stake)
