At some point we accepted gold and silver as a medium of exchange.  But these were heavy, and easy to lose so we began keeping them in banks.
<br><br/>

The banks provided its customers with notes which they could bring back and use to withdraw their gold.  After a while people just began exchanging notes instead of gold and paper money was born.

<br><br/>

Banks began lending out the gold they were storing to make a little profit.  This caused several problems:

<br><br/>

<ul>
	<li>More paper representing gold than actual gold</li>
	<li>More money in the market... higher prices, inflation </li>
	<li>Banks sometimes couldn't pay what they owed, because they had loaned it out</li>
</ul>


	Central banks were created to manage these banks and control the total supply of money but things did not improve.
	
	The U.S. is 28 trillion dollars in debt and their current strategy is to print less money each year.

Bitcoin first appeared in January 2009, the creation of a computer programmer using the
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. His invention is an open-source (its controlling computer code is
open to public view), peer-to-peer (transactions do not require a third-party intermediary such as
PayPal or Visa) digital currency (being electronic with no physical manifestation). The Bitcoin
system is private, with no traditional financial institutions involved in transactions. Unlike earlier
digital currencies that had some central controlling person or entity, the Bitcoin network is
completely decentralized, with all parts of transactions performed by the users of the system.
With a Bitcoin transaction there is no third-party intermediary. The buyer and seller interact
directly (peer to peer), but their identities are encrypted and no personal information is transferred
from one to the other. However, unlike a fully anonymous transaction, there is a transaction
record. A full transaction record of every Bitcoin and every Bitcoin userâ€™s encrypted identity is
maintained on the public ledger. For this reason, Bitcoin transactions are thought to be
pseudonymous, not anonymous. Although the scale of Bitcoin use has increased substantially, it
still remains small in comparison to traditional electronic payments systems, such as credit cards,
and the use of dollars as a circulating currency.
Congress is interested in Bitcoin because of concerns about its use in illegal money transfers,
concerns about its effect on the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet its objectives (of stable
prices, maximum employment, and financial stability), and concerns about the protection of
consumers and investors who might use Bitcoin.
Bitcoin offers users the advantages of lower transaction costs, increased privacy, and long-term
protection of loss of purchasing power from inflation. However, it also has a number of
disadvantages that could hinder wider use. These include sizable volatility of the price of
Bitcoins, uncertain security from theft and fraud, and a long-term deflationary bias that
encourages the hoarding of Bitcoins



	Precious metals served well as a medium of exchange because they:
	
	<ul>
		<li>have intrinsic value</li>
		<li>have a finite supply</li>
		<li>are difficult to find/refine/bring to the market</li>
	</ul> 
	
	Bitcoin also as 
	while Fiat money derives its value by government declaring that it has value. In the U.S., the dollar is legal tender--everyone is obligated to accept dollars for use in basic economic activities.
	<br></br>


	The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy and operates key electronic payment systems.  They act as intermediary when banks transfer money between each other
	<br></br>   


	Banks allow us to make valid exchanges: 
	<ul>
	<li>without having physical possession of currency</li> 
	<li>without being in the same physical location as the payee</li> 
	<li>without knowing/trusting the payee</li>  
	</ul>

	Banks also safekeep our money to reduce the risk of theft, loss, destruction, etc.   

	Bitcoin was designed to be an alternate electronic payment systems In 2008, a programmer or group of programers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, a digital electronic payment system where payments are validated by a decentralized network and cryptographic protocols instead of by centralized organizations (banks).

	[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

	<ul>
	<li>A network of computers validates transactions instead of a bank</li>
	<li>Cryptography is used to authenticate instead of banks</li>
	<li>Accounts, balances, and transactions are tracked on a ledger</li>
	</ul>
					
	Pros:

	<li>Money is not backed by government-fiat currency</li>
	<li>Less time for transactions</li>
	<li>Less fees to banks, credit card companies</li>
	<li>Less private data to banks and payees</li>

	Gen1 - Bitcoin  (store of value)
	Gen2 - Ethereum, Binance (smart contracts that have utility)
	Gen3 - Cardano, IOTA (smart contracts with proof of stake)

	

	Banks have a market system to be accurate (reputation) and legal reason (government)

	Banks have access to enormous amounts of data about individual's financial transactions.

	Banks and FED have ways to check if money is counterfeit. For digital currencies, counterfit is prevented by using a ledger that is cryptographically secure.


	don't borrow unless you have a specific play 

	Ride the BTC up for 72 hours, switch to ALTs and ride them up 

	Level 1 Chains:
	BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT, AVAX, Terra, MATIC, ALGO, COSMOS,

	All computers running the app (called nodes) maintain a copy of the ledger.  Every transaction is sent to all the nodes and is added to the blockchain.

	To keep a node from adding a fraudulent transaction, a complex math problem must be solved by a node before they can add a block into the ledger.  The first node to solve the problem gets a reward in coins and is allowed to write the block into the ledger. (Proof of work) (ETH 1.0)

	An alternate way is picking a node randomly based on the amount of funds "staked" on a node.  The more staked funds, the higher chance a node has of being selected to get a reward and forge a block. To prevent a node from getting to forge a majority of the blocks, at a certain point more staked funds actually decreases a node's chance of being selected. (Proof of stake) (ETH 2.0)

	Stablecoins are digital assets that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national
	currency or other reference assets. Today, stablecoins are primarily used in the United States to
	facilitate trading, lending, or borrowing of other digital assets, predominantly on or through digital
	asset trading platforms

	Stablecoins facilitate a large and growing volume of digital asset trading by allowing market
	participants to quickly convert volatile digital assets into a digital asset with more perceived
	stability, and vice versa; providing a digital asset with more perceived stability to transfer across
	platforms without the use of national currencies and reducing the need for traditional financial
	institutions; and serving as a source of collateral against which market participants can borrow
	to fund additional activity, sometimes using extremely high leverage. Market participants also
	use stablecoins to earn yield by transferring stablecoins into digital asset trading platforms,
	or by using stablecoins to serve as collateral for loans and margined transactions, in exchange
	for interest or returns. As evidence of the importance of stablecoins to the digital asset market,
	stablecoins are reportedly among the most highly traded assets as a percentage of total volume
	on several large venues that enable the trading of digital assets.
